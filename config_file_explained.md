This file, `WebServiceConfig`, configures a **SOAP Web Service** in a **Spring Boot** application using Spring Web Services. Let me walk you through each part of the file:

### 1. **`@EnableWs` and `@Configuration` Annotations**
   - **`@EnableWs`**: This annotation enables Spring Web Services, which allows you to build and publish SOAP web services in a Spring Boot application.
   - **`@Configuration`**: Marks this class as a configuration class that Spring uses to configure beans (components).

### 2. **`WsConfigurerAdapter`**
   - This is a base class that allows you to customize the configuration of Spring Web Services. By extending this class, you can define custom configurations.

### 3. **`messageDispatcherServlet` Bean**
   - **What it does**: This bean registers a `MessageDispatcherServlet`, which is a special servlet provided by Spring Web Services. It is responsible for handling incoming SOAP requests.
   
   - **Explanation**:
     - **`MessageDispatcherServlet servlet = new MessageDispatcherServlet();`**: Creates a new instance of the `MessageDispatcherServlet`.
     - **`servlet.setApplicationContext(applicationContext);`**: Connects the servlet to the Spring application context.
     - **`servlet.setTransformWsdlLocations(true);`**: Automatically transforms relative WSDL locations to absolute URLs.
     - **`new ServletRegistrationBean<>(servlet, "/ws/*");`**: Registers the `MessageDispatcherServlet` under the `/ws/*` URL. This means all SOAP requests with `/ws/*` will be routed to this servlet.

   - **Key takeaway**: This is the entry point of your SOAP service. It ensures that requests to `/ws/*` are handled by the `MessageDispatcherServlet`.

### 4. **`defaultWsdl11Definition` Bean**
   - **What it does**: This bean defines the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for your service.
   
   - **Explanation**:
     - **`DefaultWsdl11Definition wsdl11Definition = new DefaultWsdl11Definition();`**: Creates a new WSDL definition object.
     - **`wsdl11Definition.setPortTypeName("CountriesPort");`**: Sets the `PortTypeName` to "CountriesPort". This is part of the WSDL structure, defining the operations the service exposes.
     - **`wsdl11Definition.setLocationUri("/ws");`**: Specifies the location of the web service (in this case, it will be accessible at `/ws`).
     - **`wsdl11Definition.setTargetNamespace("http://www.baeldung.com/springsoap/gen");`**: Defines the target namespace, which is used to avoid naming conflicts in XML.
     - **`wsdl11Definition.setSchema(countriesSchema);`**: Associates the schema (`countries.xsd`) with the WSDL definition. The XSD defines the structure of the request and response.

   - **Key takeaway**: This bean exposes the WSDL of your SOAP service and specifies the port, location, and schema used by the service.

### 5. **`countriesSchema` Bean**
   - **What it does**: This bean loads and returns the XSD (XML Schema Definition) for your SOAP service.
   
   - **Explanation**:
     - **`SimpleXsdSchema(new ClassPathResource("countries.xsd"));`**: Loads the `countries.xsd` file from the classpath and converts it into an `XsdSchema` object.
     - **`new ClassPathResource("countries.xsd")`**: Indicates that the `countries.xsd` file should be located in the `resources` folder of your project.

   - **Key takeaway**: This bean provides the schema that defines the structure of the SOAP request and response for the service.

### **Complete Flow of the SOAP Service Setup**

1. **SOAP Request Handling**: 
   - When a SOAP request comes in at `/ws/*`, the `MessageDispatcherServlet` processes it.
   
2. **WSDL Generation**:
   - The `DefaultWsdl11Definition` bean generates a WSDL for the service that is available at `/ws/countries.wsdl`. This WSDL file tells clients how to interact with your service, including request/response formats.

3. **Schema Definition**:
   - The schema defined in `countries.xsd` is used to validate and structure the SOAP messages (requests and responses).

### **Summary**
- **MessageDispatcherServlet**: Routes all SOAP requests under `/ws/*`.
- **DefaultWsdl11Definition**: Exposes the WSDL for your service at `/ws/countries.wsdl`, providing clients with the necessary details to call the service.
- **XsdSchema**: Defines the structure of the SOAP messages (requests and responses) using an XSD file (`countries.xsd`).
